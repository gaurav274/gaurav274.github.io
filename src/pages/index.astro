					<p>I build efficient AI-powered data systems. My work lies at the intersection of databases and machine learning, with a focus on improving resource efficiency and enhancing usability. I started by rethinking how databases handle video analytics and extended those ideas to multimodal data. Most recently, my focus has shifted to making databases more usable and accessible through natural language. </p>

							) — An <a href="https://github.com/georgia-tech-db/Eva">open-source</a> database system that enables users to query multimodal data using a SQL/dataframe‑like interface. Under the hood, it transparently provides AI UDF‑centric optimizations such as UDF result reuse, UDF reordering, and parallelization to improve hardware utilization. EvaDB has gained significant recognition, amassing approximately <strong>2.7K</strong> GitHub stars.

							<strong>Aero</strong> (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3725408">SIGMOD 2025</a>) — Argues that ML‑centric DBMSs should replace <em>static</em>, profile‑based optimizers with <em>adaptive query processing</em>. Aero notes that collecting accurate UDF (AI operator) statistics is costly and unreliable; instead, it measures selectivity and cost at runtime to reorder and route predicates on the fly, and employs dynamic scaling to improve resource utilization.

						<li>
							<strong>PRISM</strong> (under review) — While NL2SQL research has largely focused on maximizing accuracy, the monetary cost of LLM-based pipelines has been overlooked. Real-world deployments must balance accuracy and cost, but the configuration space (LLM choice, prompting, schema linking) is highly interdependent and schema-sensitive. PRISM tackles this schema-aware tuning challenge.
